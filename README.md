# Power-BI-Business-Insights-360

## Summary
This project was made from my enrollment in [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/) [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance). The bootcamp exhibits a fictional company called AtliQ Technologies which is rapidly proliferating to many markets around the globe. However, AtliQ relied on Excel files for their data analytics needs which made it difficult and time consuming to easily generate insights from sales data, hindering AtliQ's growth in Latin America. The objective of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard for which stakeholders from various business departments such as finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive can quickly and effectively gather insights from the data to make better informed decisions.
